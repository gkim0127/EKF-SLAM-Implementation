Compsys 732 project

## Project 1: Sensing
- Determine which features within the environment are suitable for utilising for localisation and mapping
- Access the robot's depth information by subscribing to the relevant sensor topic feeds
- Implement a means of extracting those features from the depth sensor on the Turtlebot platform - using Opencv/Opend3d or other libraries

## Project 2 - Localisation
- Determine the robot's pose within the environment using the measured position of the landmarks/walls relative to the robot and the robot's odometry
- Programmatically or manually drive the robot in a square (or desired path) a few times and display the measured path (poses) of the robot on screen vs the instructed path (poses)
- Drive the robot around the square and evaluate how well it tracks its location within the map

## Project 3 - EKF-SLAM
- Landmark extraction
- Implement the EKF-SLAM algorithm
- Explore what happens if you add more or less landmarks while traversing the environment

## Autonomous mowing robot design report
- Designing autonomous mowing robot with specifications
